# Puupdex (Pupdex)

Pupdex is a dog breed classifier app, built using Kivy, KivyMD with extra features from Firebase and Open-CV.

## Installation

##[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is required. IT IS ESSENTIAL.

Go to the directory where you store Pupdex and then open a terminal there.

1. Create a virtual environment within Pupdex:

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
.env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(If you're not familiar with creating a virtual environment, you can safely ignore step 1 and 2 and install all requirements globally.)

## Usage

Run main.py for the application to load.

The default account to test is:

```bash
admin@demo.stable
123456
```

But you could use your very own account if needed to.
